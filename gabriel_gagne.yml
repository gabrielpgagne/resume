  - organization: Smartek Technologies
    position: Embedded Software Developer
    url: https://smartrek.io
    location: Breakeyville, QC, Canada
    startDate: 2020-10-15
    endDate: 2023-12-31
    highlights:
      - Developed a cutting-edge ultrasonic inspection device leveraging tight integration between an FPGA and Smartrek's RF technology. The main focus was put on ensuring a fully remotely configurable and operable device, as well as edge processing.
      - Increased the amount of free flash memory by up to 50% on our microcontroller by porting custom libraries to a modern compiler.
      - Significantly improved flexibility and reliability of internal production tools by re-designing from the ground up the tools' software architecture.
      - Contributed to the integration of over 4 new sensor types into Smartrek's product stack, including hardware revision, firmware code, Android app and Web app development.

  - organization: SiFi Labs
    position: Master's Research Intern
    url: https://sifilabs.com
    location: Québec, QC, Canada
    startDate: 2023-05-15
    endDate: 2023-09-15
    highlights:
      - Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including signal processing, feature extraction from datasets or from real-time SiFi device data, saving the processed data, training a ML model and inferring.
      #- Designed a hybrid PCB for their flagship product. The PCB includes a flex part that is removable from the main board, allowing for easier and cheaper hardware revisions than having to re-design the entire PCB.
      - Developed a fully cross-platform command-line tool in Rust that can interact with all of SiFi Labs' devices. This tool propels forward the development and experimentation capabilities of researchers and developers. Python wrappers and JNI bindings were also created to use the tool from other languages.
      - Provided DevOps insight, notably for documentation and version control, by restructuring many repositories, writing clear documentation (code, readmes, user's guides), and automatisation scripts.
